## Git Commands
<b>There are 3 main git commands:</b>

* **git add `<file/folder names>`** - This is used to add files, folders, etc. to local staging environment. So Git knows context or objects you want to to push to your repo
* **git add -A** - This is used to add all the files and folders in your current directory
* **git commit -m `<enter your git message here>`** - This is used to attach a contextual message to the your git files you'll be pushing
* **git push** - This pushes your local files to your git repo

## Markdown

Files that end in `.md` are known as markdown files, an example of this would be a Readme file used in a git repository. 
- README - A file used to provide basic instructions or a description of git repository, for instance what the git repository is for what it does, what your source code  aims to achieve, literally anything you want people to read when they access your repository. 
  - The markdown language has certain commands you can use to style your documents, similar to the workout website created.
  
  - <h2 style="color:blue">Commands</h2>
  - 
    - "**\*\***" : **bold**
    - "**_**" or "**\***": _italics_
    - **\`** text **\`** : `code blocks`
    - "**\#**" : <b style="font-size:34px">header-size-1</b>,<br>"**\#\#**" : <b style="font-size:30px">header-size-2</b>,<br>"**\#\#\#**" : <b style="font-size:24px">header-size-3</b>
    - **\<html tags\>** : you can use many html tags your familiar with as well as the markdown commands to format and style the documents.

## Additional Git commands

- **git checkout** `<branch-name>` - To switch to a different branch
- **git checkout -b** `<new-branch-name>` - To create a new branch _[Note: branch won't be created until you actually push to the new branch]_
- **git branch** `<branch-name>` - To view all branches in your local repo
- 

## Approach to coding
- To develop logical reasoning - it's better to try and figure things out before using the net, in doing so you learn a lot more. e.g. learning how to do other things which might be useful in the future.
